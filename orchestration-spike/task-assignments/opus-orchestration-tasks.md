# Claude Opus - Orchestration Tasks & Responsibilities

## Primary Role
Team Lead and Multi-Provider Orchestrator for Todo List Web Application Development

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Strategic Planning & Task Breakdown
- **Task**: Analyze todo app requirements and create detailed implementation plan
- **Deliverable**: Comprehensive task assignments for each AI provider
- **Success Criteria**: Clear, actionable tasks with defined success metrics
- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

### 2. Provider Coordination & Assignment
- **Task**: Match tasks to optimal AI providers based on capabilities
- **Deliverable**: Strategic provider assignments with rationale
- **Success Criteria**: Optimal task-provider matching for efficiency
- **Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes

### 3. Progress Monitoring & Communication
- **Task**: Track progress across all providers and coordinate handoffs
- **Deliverable**: Real-time status updates and coordination decisions
- **Success Criteria**: Smooth inter-provider communication and workflow
- **Estimated Time**: Ongoing throughout session

### 4. Escalation Handling (3-Strike System)
- **Task**: Intervene when providers fail after 3 attempts
- **Deliverable**: Resolution of provider failures and task completion
- **Success Criteria**: Successful resolution of escalated tasks
- **Expected Escalations**: 2-4 interventions during session

### 5. Integration Resolution
- **Task**: Resolve compatibility issues between different AI provider outputs
- **Deliverable**: Working integration between frontend (OpenAI) and backend (Gemini)
- **Success Criteria**: Seamless operation of multi-provider generated code
- **Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes

### 6. Quality Assurance & Final Review
- **Task**: Comprehensive review of all deliverables and functionality
- **Deliverable**: Quality assessment and final validation
- **Success Criteria**: Working todo app meeting all requirements
- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Orchestration Decision Points

### Provider Selection Rationale
- **OpenAI GPT-4** → Frontend: Strong UI/UX capabilities, clean HTML/CSS/JS generation
- **Google Gemini** → Backend: Excellent API design, robust server-side logic
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5** → QA: Cost-effective testing, comprehensive validation

### Coordination Protocols
1. **Sequential with Validation**: Complete each phase before proceeding
2. **Cross-Provider Handoffs**: Explicit integration points with validation
3. **Quality Checkpoints**: Review outputs before next phase
4. **Issue Escalation**: Clear triggers for orchestrator intervention

### Integration Challenges to Anticipate
- **Code Style Differences**: Varying approaches between OpenAI and Gemini
- **API Compatibility**: Ensuring frontend calls match backend implementation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across providers
- **Testing Integration**: QA agent validating multi-provider outputs

## Metrics & Performance Tracking

### My Orchestration Metrics
- **Coordination Tokens**: Track tokens used for orchestration vs. work
- **Decision Count**: Number of strategic decisions made
- **Escalation Success**: Rate of successful escalation resolutions
- **Integration Fixes**: Manual interventions needed for compatibility
- **Time Efficiency**: Orchestration overhead vs. direct work time

### Provider Performance Analysis
- **Cost Efficiency**: Compare tokens/quality ratio across providers
- **Task Suitability**: Which providers excel at which task types
- **Reliability Scoring**: Success rates and failure patterns
- **Integration Compatibility**: How well outputs work together

## Expected Challenges & Mitigation

### Challenge 1: API Integration Compatibility
- **Risk**: Frontend (OpenAI) and Backend (Gemini) using different patterns
- **Mitigation**: Define explicit API contract before development starts
- **Escalation**: Direct intervention to create compatibility layer

### Challenge 2: Code Quality Variations
- **Risk**: Different AI providers producing inconsistent code styles
- **Mitigation**: Clear style guidelines in task assignments
- **Escalation**: Manual code review and standardization

### Challenge 3: Provider Failures
- **Risk**: API timeouts, rate limits, or quality issues
- **Mitigation**: 3-strike system with provider switching
- **Escalation**: Direct task completion by myself or Sonnet fallback

### Challenge 4: Integration Testing
- **Risk**: QA agent unable to test multi-provider integration effectively
- **Mitigation**: Provide integrated test environment and clear scenarios
- **Escalation**: Manual integration testing and validation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- [ ] Working todo app with all CRUD functionality
- [ ] Frontend and backend communicate properly
- [ ] All tests pass and validate functionality
- [ ] Code quality meets defined thresholds

### Orchestration Success
- [ ] Effective coordination across multiple AI providers
- [ ] Successful escalation handling when needed
- [ ] Efficient resource allocation and task assignment
- [ ] Clear documentation of orchestration decisions

### Performance Success
- [ ] Complete metrics collection across all providers
- [ ] Cost-effectiveness analysis completed
- [ ] Quality comparison between providers documented
- [ ] Integration challenges identified and resolved

## Deliverables & Documentation

### Session Documentation
- **Real-time Coordination Log**: All decisions and interventions
- **Provider Performance Analysis**: Comparative effectiveness report
- **Integration Resolution Documentation**: How compatibility was achieved
- **Escalation Case Studies**: Detailed analysis of failure handling

### Strategic Insights
- **Provider Strengths/Weaknesses**: Optimal task assignments for future
- **Cost Optimization Recommendations**: Most efficient provider usage
- **Orchestration Improvements**: Lessons learned for system enhancement
- **UI Requirements**: Dashboard needs for multi-provider visibility

## Time Allocation

- **Planning & Setup**: 45 minutes
- **Active Coordination**: 3-4 hours
- **Integration Resolution**: 60 minutes
- **Quality Review**: 45 minutes
- **Documentation**: 30 minutes
- **Total Orchestration Time**: 5-6 hours

This orchestration role focuses entirely on strategic coordination, never direct coding, demonstrating the value of AI orchestration across multiple providers.
