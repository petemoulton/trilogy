# Trilogy Multi-Provider AI Orchestration Spike Test

## Project Overview
This spike test validates Trilogy's ability to orchestrate agents from multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini) with Claude Opus as the team lead. The test includes comprehensive performance benchmarking, cost tracking, failure handling, and quality assessment.

## Test Objectives
1. **Multi-Provider Orchestration**: Test Claude Opus coordinating different AI providers
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure token consumption, costs, and efficiency across providers
3. **Reliability Testing**: Validate 3-strike failure handling and escalation system
4. **Quality Assessment**: Compare code quality and integration compatibility
5. **UI Requirements**: Document dashboard components needed for multi-provider visibility

## Target Project
**Simple Todo List Web App**
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (OpenAI GPT-4)
- Backend: Express.js API with JSON storage (Google Gemini)
- Testing: Unit and integration tests (OpenAI GPT-3.5)
- Orchestration: Task coordination and integration (Claude Opus)
