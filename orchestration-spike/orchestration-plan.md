## Task Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Task Breakdown (Opus)
1. Load todo app requirements and specifications
2. Create detailed task assignments for each provider
3. Define success criteria and quality thresholds
4. Initialize metrics tracking and logging systems
5. Set up failure handling and escalation protocols

### Phase 2: Parallel Development (Multi-Provider)
1. **Frontend Development** (OpenAI GPT-4)
   - Create HTML structure and CSS styling
   - Implement JavaScript todo functionality
   - Develop frontend unit tests
2. **Backend Development** (Google Gemini)
   - Build Express server and API endpoints
   - Implement data persistence layer
   - Create backend API tests
3. **QA Planning** (OpenAI GPT-3.5)
   - Develop comprehensive test strategy
   - Prepare integration test scenarios

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Coordinated)
1. **Integration Coordination** (Opus)
   - Ensure frontend and backend compatibility
   - Resolve any cross-provider integration issues
   - Coordinate final testing phase
2. **Integration Testing** (OpenAI GPT-3.5)
   - Execute end-to-end integration tests
   - Validate full application functionality
   - Generate quality and coverage reports

### Phase 4: Final Review & Validation (Opus)
1. Comprehensive functionality testing
2. Code quality assessment across all components
3. Performance and metrics analysis
4. Final integration validation
5. Generate comprehensive results report

## Quality Gates & Success Criteria

### Technical Quality Gates
- [ ] All code compiles and runs without errors
- [ ] Frontend interface displays and functions correctly
- [ ] Backend API endpoints respond properly
- [ ] Frontend and backend communicate successfully
- [ ] All CRUD operations work as specified
- [ ] Tests validate core functionality effectively

### Metrics Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete token consumption tracking per provider
- [ ] All failures and retries documented with costs
- [ ] 3-strike escalation system validated in practice
- [ ] Quality scores assigned across all deliverables
- [ ] Cross-provider performance comparison completed
- [ ] Integration challenges documented and resolved

### Integration Success Criteria
- [ ] Different AI provider outputs work together seamlessly
- [ ] Any compatibility issues resolved through orchestration
- [ ] Clear documentation of cross-provider coordination
- [ ] Successful demonstration of multi-provider orchestration

## Failure Handling Protocol

### 3-Strike Escalation System
1. **Strike 1**: Retry task with refined prompt and additional context
2. **Strike 2**: Retry with different approach or switch to fallback provider
3. **Strike 3**: Escalate to Opus for direct intervention and resolution

### Escalation Triggers
- API errors (network, authentication, rate limits)
- Code compilation or runtime errors
- Integration compatibility issues
- Quality threshold failures
- Repeated task failures across providers

### Resolution Strategies
- Provider switching (OpenAI â†” Gemini)
- Prompt refinement and context enhancement
- Direct intervention by Opus orchestrator
- Task scope adjustment or simplification
- Manual integration fixes for compatibility

## Expected Outcomes

### Primary Deliverables
1. **Working Todo Application**: Functional web app created through multi-provider coordination
2. **Comprehensive Code Base**: All source code with clear provider attribution
3. **Test Suite**: Complete testing validation across components
4. **Integration Documentation**: How different AI outputs were made compatible

### Analysis Reports
1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Token usage, costs, and efficiency by provider
2. **Reliability Assessment**: Failure patterns, success rates, escalation effectiveness
3. **Quality Comparison**: Code quality scores across different AI providers
4. **Orchestration Analysis**: Effectiveness of multi-provider coordination

### Strategic Insights
1. **Provider Strengths/Weaknesses**: Which AI excels at which task types
2. **Cost Optimization**: Most cost-effective provider assignments
3. **Integration Challenges**: Common cross-provider compatibility issues
4. **UI Requirements**: Dashboard components needed for multi-provider visibility
5. **Scalability Lessons**: Insights for larger orchestration projects

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Failures**: Multiple provider support with automatic fallback
- **Integration Issues**: Opus intervention for compatibility resolution
- **Quality Problems**: Clear thresholds with escalation to improvement
- **Cost Overruns**: Token budgets and monitoring with alerts

### Process Risks
- **Time Management**: Realistic timeboxes with progress checkpoints
- **Scope Creep**: Clear requirements with minimal viable functionality focus
- **Communication Gaps**: Comprehensive logging and status tracking
- **Provider Reliability**: Multi-provider redundancy and fallback options

This orchestration plan provides a structured approach to testing multi-provider AI coordination while generating actionable insights for system optimization and future development.
