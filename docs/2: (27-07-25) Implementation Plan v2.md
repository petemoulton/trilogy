## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Current State
```
PRD → Sonnet Agent → Opus Agent → Tasks → Dashboard
```

### Target State  
```
PRD → Team Lead (Opus) → Agent Pool (A1,A2,A3,A4...) → Task Allocation → Human Gates → QA Agent → Delivery
```

### Core Components to Build
1. **Agent Pool Manager** - Dynamic specialist agent spawning
2. **Task Allocation Engine** - Team Lead assigns task batches to agents
3. **Dependency Resolution System** - Block/unblock agents based on completion
4. **Human Approval Gates** - Quality review checkpoints
5. **QA/Test Agent** - Automated testing and validation
6. **Enhanced Dashboard** - Real-time agent coordination view
