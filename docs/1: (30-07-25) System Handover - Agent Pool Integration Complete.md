## üîß Technical Achievements

### 1. **Agent Pool Connection Resolution** ‚ö° CRITICAL FIX
**Problem**: Agents were running but not visible in server pool statistics (showed 0 agents)
**Root Cause**: Main agents (Sonnet/Opus) were stored separately from AgentPool registry
**Solution**: 
- Modified AgentRunner to register main agents in AgentPool maps
- Created cross-process HTTP API for agent statistics (port 3102)
- Implemented fallback bridge communication for same-process scenarios

**Technical Details**:
```javascript
// Fixed in src/shared/agents/runner.js
this.agentPool.agents.set('sonnet', sonnetAgent);
this.agentPool.agents.set('opus', opusAgent);
this.agentPool.agentStatus.set('sonnet', { /* complete agent metadata */ });
```

**Result**: Pool now correctly shows 2 agents with full status information

### 2. **Dashboard Implementation** üñ•Ô∏è NEW FEATURE
**Agent Pool Tab**:
- Real-time statistics (Total: 2, Idle: 2, Active: 0, Error: 0)
- Live agent cards showing role, status, capabilities, tasks completed
- Capabilities overview with all available agent skills
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds via `/agents/pool/status` API

**Logs Tab**:
- Terminal-style log viewer with syntax highlighting
- Log level filtering (All, Error, Warning, Info, Debug)
- Auto-scroll functionality with toggle control
- Clear logs functionality
- Real-time updates every 3 seconds (currently simulated)

**Dark Mode**:
- Complete CSS variable system for light/dark themes
- Persistent user preference via localStorage
- Toggle button in Settings tab
- Professional color scheme optimized for long viewing sessions

### 3. **Architecture Improvements** üèóÔ∏è
**Modular JavaScript System**:
- `agent-manager.js`: Handles live agent pool data and UI updates
- `log-manager.js`: Manages log display, filtering, and controls
- Enhanced `tab-manager.js`: Initializes modules when tabs are activated
- Comprehensive CSS in `dashboard.css`: 80+ new style rules

**Cross-Process Communication**:
- Agent Runner API server on port 3102
- HTTP-based communication between server (3100) and runner (3102)
- Graceful fallback to bridge pattern for same-process scenarios
- Error handling with detailed logging
