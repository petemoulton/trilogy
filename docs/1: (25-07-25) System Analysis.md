- **API Documentation**: Complete REST API reference in API.md

## üîÑ Core Workflows

### 1. **PRD Analysis Pipeline**
1. PRD uploaded/edited via dashboard or memory API
2. Sonnet agent analyzes document structure and requirements
3. Generates comprehensive feature breakdown with complexity scoring
4. Results stored in `/memory/prd/` namespace with Git logging

### 2. **Task Generation & Approval**
1. Sonnet processes requirements into structured task list
2. Each task includes: priority, complexity, dependencies, blockers, time estimates
3. Opus reviews all generated tasks using multi-criteria evaluation
4. Tasks are approved, rejected, or modified based on strategic scoring
5. Final roadmap generated with phased timeline and milestones

### 3. **Browser Automation**
1. Chrome extension captures DOM interactions and user workflows
2. Macro recording system stores interaction sequences  
3. WebSocket communication enables real-time automation control
4. Session data persisted in SQLite with dashboard visibility
