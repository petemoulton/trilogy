GET /agents/pool/status (3000) # ✅ {"status":"ok","activeSessions":2,"eventCount":2}
```

### **🌐 Chrome Extension Integration**

#### **Issue Identified & Resolved**
- **Problem**: Extension attempting connection to port 3100 instead of 3000
- **Root Cause**: Port mismatch in 3 extension files
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `docs/materials/chromeext/extension/background.js:3`
  - `docs/materials/chromeext/extension/popup.js:3` 
  - `docs/materials/chromeext/extension/recorder.js:222`

#### **Post-Fix Verification**
- ✅ **Connection Status**: Chrome extension successfully connected to MCP server
- ✅ **Event Capture**: Click events being captured and logged in real-time
- ✅ **Session Management**: Active sessions tracked (activeSessions:2)
- ✅ **Dashboard Integration**: Extension status shows "Connected" in main dashboard
- ✅ **Real-Time Logging**: Live event stream visible in startup logs

**Evidence from Live Logs**:
```
[MCP] Click event received: {
  event: { type: 'click', tagName: 'button', text: '🔄 Refresh' }
  url: 'http://localhost:8080/', timestamp: 1753631798160
}
[MCP] Click event received: {
