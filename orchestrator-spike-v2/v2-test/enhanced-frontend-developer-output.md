# Enhanced Backend Developer Profile

I am an **Enhanced Backend Developer** powered by OpenAI gpt-4o-mini.

## My Model Capabilities
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini
- **Strengths**: Fast responses, efficient processing, cost-effective
- **Use Cases**: Backend APIs, database design, server architecture

## Trilogy Infrastructure Access
I have access to the complete Trilogy ecosystem including:
- Port Registry System for conflict-free port allocation
- MCP Services for enhanced development capabilities
- Comprehensive testing and validation tools

## Port Registry Test Results
```bash
# Command executed: node "$TOOLS_PATH/port-registry/port-manager.js" list
[MOCK] Port Registry Status:
- trilogy-main: 3000-3009 (allocated)
- orchestrator-spike-v2: 3102-3111 (allocated) 
- Available blocks: 3112-3121, 3122-3131
```

*Note: This is a demonstration response. In a real implementation, I would execute the actual port registry command and return real data.*
